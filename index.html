		<h1>Developing a Website</h1>
		<p>I'm so hungry I really wanna go eat something. I want french fries or like hot melted cheese. The first step to creating a website is to create a folder. Once the folder has been created create three folders inside of it. These three folders are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>css</li>
			<li>js</li>
			<li>images</li>
		</ul>
		<p>After the folders have been created open <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text.</a> Once Sublime has opened:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Drag the website folder onto the Sublime Icon. On windows you'd have to open it through Sublime.</li>
			<li>Create a new file - File -> new</li>
			<li>Save the file in the root of the website folder as index.html</li>
		</ol>
